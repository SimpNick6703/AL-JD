**Task 2**: Create a small Ruby on Rails app called Autodialer - Take 100 random Indian phone numbers and call them automatically one by one. Can you add an AI prompt so I can just saw or type tasks like “make a call to XXXXXX number?” in an AI prompt. 

**Task 3**: Generate 10 articles on various programming topics using AI tools. Can you add an AI prompt so I can just type the list of titles with some details, and it will generate the content?
